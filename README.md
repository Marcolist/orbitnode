# OrbitNode – EigenLayer Operator

**OrbitNode** is an independent EigenLayer operator focused on reliable, conservative infrastructure and long-term protocol alignment.

We operate **bare-metal hardware** on dedicated servers, prioritizing stability, security, and predictable operations over aggressive experimentation.

## 🧱 Infrastructure Philosophy

OrbitNode follows a **conservative operations model**:

- Bare-metal deployment (no oversubscribed VPS)
- Dedicated server hardware
- High memory availability
- Strict monitoring & alerting
- Controlled update cadence
- Minimal attack surface

We optimize for **uptime, correctness, and protocol safety** rather than short-term reward maximization.

---

## 🔐 Security & Operations

- Dedicated operator keys (ECDSA + BLS)
- Local encrypted keystore
- No shared infrastructure
- No third-party signing services
- Logs and disk usage actively monitored
- Fail-fast and restart-oriented setup

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Reliability

- Continuous health checks
- Disk, memory, and process monitoring
- Log rotation and resource limits
- Alerting on degraded performance

Our goal is boring infrastructure — because boring infrastructure is reliable infrastructure.

---

## 🤝 Delegation Policy

- Open delegation (no delegation approver)
- Long-term aligned with EigenLayer ecosystem
- No delegation caps at launch
- No preferential treatment

We aim to be a dependable choice for stakers who value stability and responsible operations.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Operating on EigenLayer involves smart contract and protocol risk.  
Delegation is always at the discretion and responsibility of the staker.
